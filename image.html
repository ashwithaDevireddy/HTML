		<h1>HELLO WORLD</h1> <!-- H1 TAG IS USED TO PRINT THE HEADING FOR THE WEBPAGE -->
		<p> Hello everyone</p> <!-- p tag is used to distinguish one line of the webpage from the other --> 
		<p> My name is Ashwitha</p>
		I like Strawberries <br>
<!-- The new line can be written in 2 ways:
					1.using p (i.e) paragraph tag
					2. using br tag
The paragraph tag needs space and should be opened and closed whenever new line is to be inserted instead we can use the br tag to break the line into a new line -->
		I also like pink color
		<img src="tulip.jpg" alt="no image"/> <!-- Image tag is used with src (i.e) source  attribute to determine the location from where the image is considered and alt (i.e) alternative tag is used to display the text that is mentioned when the image cannot be displayed -->
